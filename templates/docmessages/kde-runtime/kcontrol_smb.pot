"In many small local area networks, the <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"protocol is used to offer network services. Names like <quote>"
"&Windows; Network</quote> or <quote>&Windows; for Workgroups Network</quote> "
"or <quote>LanManager</quote> are often used as well. Using <acronym>"
"SMB</acronym> you can access so-called <quote>shares</quote> "

"&kde; comes with built-in support for the <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"protocol. As &kde; is network-transparent that means you can access <acronym>"
"SMB</acronym> shares from everywhere you can access your local files, for "
"example in the &konqueror; file manager and in the file dialog. To make use of "
"this you should provide &kde; with some information on your <acronym>"
"SMB</acronym> network. But don't worry, this is normally pretty simple as, for "
"example, all the Windows clients in your network need and have the same "
"information."

"Although there are a lot of insecure <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"networks out there which allow access to anyone, in principle you have to "
"authenticate yourself to access the services of an <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"server. By default, &kde; will use the data entered in the <guilabel>"
"Default user name</guilabel> and <guilabel>Default password</guilabel> "
"fields to authenticate itself on <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"hosts. If you leave the field <guilabel>Default user name</guilabel> "
"empty, &kde; will try to access <acronym>SMB</acronym> "
"hosts without a username. If you leave the default password empty, it will try "
"without a password. If &kde; is unsuccessful accessing the host using these "
"settings, you will be asked for a username and a password."

"While it makes things more comfortable if &kde; stores your <acronym>"
"SMB</acronym> password, this may be a security problem. If you are using "
"<acronym>SMB</acronym> in a security conscious environment, you should not "
"store your password here but rather enter it anew every time you need to access "
"an <acronym>SMB</acronym> host."
