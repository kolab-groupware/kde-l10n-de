"APSfilter is used mainly in the context of \"classical\" &UNIX; printing "
"(BSD-style LPD). It is a sophisticated shell script, disguised as an "
"\"all-in-one\" filtering program. In reality, APSfilter calls \"real filters\" "
"to do the jobs needed. It sends printjobs automatically through these other "
"filters, based on an initial file-type analysis of the printfile. It is written "
"and maintained by Andreas Klemm.&newpara; It is similar to Magicfilter and "
"mostly uses Ghostscript for file conversions. Some Linux Distributions (like "
"&SuSE;) use APSfilter, others Magicfilter (like &RedHat;), some have both for "
"preference selection (like *BSD).&newpara; &CUPS; has &emstart;no&emend; need "
"for APSfilter, as it runs its own file type recognition (based on &MIME; types) "

"Generic term for different variants of the traditional &UNIX; printing method. "
"Its first version appeared in the early 70s on BSD &UNIX; and was formally "
"described in &linkstart;\"http://www.rfc.net/rfc1179.html\"&linkmid;RFC "
"1179&linkend; only as late as 1990.&newpara; At the time when BSD \"remote\" "
"printing was first designed, printers were serially or otherwise directly "
"connected devices to a host (with the Internet hardly consisting of more than "
"100 nodes!); printers used hole-punched, continuous paper, fed through by a "
"tractor mechanism, with simple rows of ASCII text mechanically hammered on to "
"the medium, drawn from a cardboard box beneath the table. It came out like a "
"zig-zag folded paper \"snake\". Remote printing consisted of a neighboring host "
"in the next room sending a file asking for printout.&newpara; How technology "
"has changed! Printers generally use cut-sheet media, they have built-in "
"intelligence to compute the raster images of pages after pages that are sent to "
"them using one of the powerful page description languages (PDL). Many are "
"network nodes in their own right, with CPU, RAM, a hard disk and their own "
"Operation System, and are hooked to a net with potentially millions of "
"users...&newpara; It is a vast proof of the flexible &UNIX; concept for doing "
"things, that it made \"Line Printing\" reliably work even under these modern "
"conditions. But time has finally come now to go for something new -- the IPP."

"Already years ago, when Linux printing was still really difficult (only command "
"line printing was known to most Linux users, no device specific print options "
"were available for doing the jobs), Grant Taylor, author of the \"Linux "
"Printing HOWTO\", collected most of the available information about printers, "
"drivers and filters in his database.&newpara; With the emerging &CUPS; concept, "
"extending the use of PPDs even to non-PostScript printers, he realized the "
"potential of this database: if one puts the different datablobs (with content "
"that could be described along the lines \"Which device prints with which "
"Ghostscript or other filter?\", \"How well?\", and \"What command line switches "
"are available?\") into PPD-compatible files, he could have all the power of "
"&CUPS; on top of the traditional printer \"drivers\".&newpara; This has now "
"developed into a broader concept, known as \"Foomatic\". Foomatic extends the "
"capabilities of spoolers other than &CUPS; (LPR/LPD, LPRng, PDQ, PPR) to a "
"certain degree (\"stealing\" some concepts from &CUPS;). The Linuxprinting "
"Database is not a Linux-only stop -- people running other &UNIX; based OSes "
"(like *BSD or &MacOS; X) will also find valuable information and software "

"This is the second flavor of traditional &UNIX; printing (as opposed to "
"BSD-style printing). It uses a different command set (lp, lpadmin,...) to BSD, "
"but is not fundamentally different from it. However, the gap between the two is "
"big enough to make the two incompatible, so that a BSD-client cannot simply "
"print to a System V style print server without additional tweaking... IPP is "
"supposed to resolve this weakness and more."
