"looks for application handbooks in a location that depends on how &kde; was "
"installed on your computer. There are a number of possible reasons why it could "
"not find the documentation you requested. The document might not exist, or it "
"may not have been installed along with the application."

"Start by searching the <ulink url=\"http://docs.kde.org/\">"
"KDE Documentation site</ulink> for the requested documentation. If you find the "
"documentation on that site, your distribution might ship a separate package for "
"documentation (&eg; called kdepim-doc for all applications from the kdepim "
"module, like &kmail;, &kontact;, &etc;). Please use the package manager of your "
"distribution to find and install the missing documentation."
