"2500 years ago, the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus classified the "
"brightnesses of visible stars in the sky on a scale from 1 to 6. He called the "
"very brightest stars in the sky <quote>first magnitude</quote>"
", and the very faintest stars he could see <quote>sixth magnitude</quote>"
". Amazingly, two and a half millenia later, Hipparchus's classification scheme "
"is still widely used by astronomers, although it has since been modernized and "
"quantified."

"If you do not understand the math, this just says that the magnitude of a given "
"star (m) is different from that of some standard star (m<subscript>0</subscript>"
") by 2.5 times the logarithm of their flux ratio. The 2.5 *log factor means "
"that if the flux ratio is 100, the difference in magnitudes is 5 mag. So, a 6th "
"magnitude star is 100 times fainter than a 1st magnitude star. The reason "
"Hipparchus's simple classification translates to a relatively complex function "
"is that the human eye responds logarithmically to light."

"There are several different magnitude scales in use, each of which serves a "
"different purpose. The most common is the apparent magnitude scale; this is "
"just the measure of how bright stars (and other objects) look to the human eye. "
"The apparent magnitude scale defines the star Vega to have magnitude 0.0, and "
"assigns magnitudes to all other objects using the above equation, and a measure "
"of the flux ratio of each object to Vega."

"It is difficult to understand stars using just the apparent magnitudes. Imagine "
"two stars in the sky with the same apparent magnitude, so they appear to be "
"equally bright. You cannot know just by looking if the two have the same "
"<emphasis>intrinsic</emphasis> brightness; it is possible that one star is "
"intrinsically brighter, but further away. If we knew the distances to the stars "
"(see the <link linkend=\"ai-parallax\">parallax</link> "
"article), we could account for their distances and assign <firstterm>"
"Absolute magnitudes</firstterm> which would reflect their true, intrinsic "
"brightness. The absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude the "
"star would have if observed from a distance of 10 parsecs (1 parsec is 3.26 "
"light-years, or 3.1 x 10<superscript>18</superscript> "
"cm). The absolute magnitude (M) can be determined from the apparent magnitude "
"(m) and the distance in parsecs (d) using the formula:"

"The modern magnitude scale is no longer based on the human eye; it is based on "
"photographic plates and photoelectric photometers. With telescopes, we can see "
"objects much fainter than Hipparchus could see with his unaided eyes, so the "
"magnitude scale has been extended beyond 6th magnitude. In fact, the Hubble "
"Space Telescope can image stars nearly as faint as 30th magnitude, which is one "
"<emphasis>trillion</emphasis> times fainter than Vega."
