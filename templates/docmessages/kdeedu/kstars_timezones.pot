"The Earth is round, and it is always half-illuminated by the Sun. However, "
"because the Earth is spinning, the half that is illuminated is always changing. "
"We experience this as the passing of days wherever we are on the Earth's "
"surface. At any given instant, there are places on the Earth passing from the "
"dark half into the illuminated half (which is seen as <emphasis>dawn</emphasis> "
"on the surface). At the same instant, on the opposite side of the Earth, points "
"are passing from the illuminated half into darkness (which is seen as <emphasis>"
"dusk</emphasis> at those locations). So, at any given time, different places on "
"Earth are experiencing different parts of the day. Thus, Solar time is defined "
"locally, so that the clock time at any location describes the part of the day "
"consistently."

"This localization of time is accomplished by dividing the globe into 24 "
"vertical slices called <firstterm>Time Zones</firstterm>"
". The Local Time is the same within any given zone, but the time in each zone "
"is one Hour <emphasis>earlier</emphasis> than the time in the neighboring Zone "
"to the East. Actually, this is a idealized simplification; real Time Zone "
"boundaries are not straight vertical lines, because they often follow national "
"boundaries and other political considerations."

"Note that because the Local Time always increases by an hour when moving "
"between Zones to the East, by the time you move through all 24 Time Zones, you "
"are a full day ahead of where you started. We deal with this paradox by "
"defining the <firstterm>International Date Line</firstterm>"
", which is a Time Zone boundary in the Pacific Ocean, between Asia and North "
"America. Points just to the East of this line are 24 hours behind the points "
"just to the West of the line. This leads to some interesting phenomena. A "
"direct flight from Australia to California arrives before it departs. Also, the "
"islands of Fiji straddle the International Date Line, so if you have a bad day "
"on the West side of Fiji, you can go over to the East side of Fiji and have a "
"chance to live the same day all over again."
