"The <quote>What's Up Tonight?</quote> (WUT) tool displays a list of objects "
"that will be visible at night from any location, on any date. By default, the "
"Date and Location are taken from the current settings in the main window, but "
"you can change either value using the <guibutton>Change Date</guibutton> "
"and <guibutton>Change Location</guibutton> buttons at the top of the WUT "
"window."

"Below the almanac is where the object information is displayed. The objects are "
"organized into type categories. Select an object type in the box labeled "
"<guilabel>Select a Category</guilabel>, and all objects of that type which are "
"above the horizon on the selected night will be displayed in the box labeled "
"<guilabel>Matching Objects</guilabel>. For example, in the screenshot, the "
"<guilabel>Planets</guilabel> category has been selected, and four planets which "
"are up on the selected night are displayed (Mars, Neptune, Pluto, and Uranus). "
"When an object in the list is selected, its rise, set and transit times are "
"displayed in the lower-right panel. In addition, you can press the <guibutton>"
"Object Details...</guibutton> button to open the <link linkend=\"tool-details\">"
"Object Details window</link> for that object."
