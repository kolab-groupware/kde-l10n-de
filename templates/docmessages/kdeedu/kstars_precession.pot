"<firstterm>Precession</firstterm> is the gradual change in the direction of the "
"Earth's spin axis. The spin axis traces a cone, completing a full circuit in "
"26,000 years. If you have ever spun a top or a dreidel, the <quote>"
"wobbling</quote> rotation of the top as it spins is precession."

"The reason for the Earth's precession is complicated. The Earth is not a "
"perfect sphere, it is a bit flattened, meaning the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">Great Circle</link> of the equator is longer than a "
"<quote>meridonal</quote> great circle that passes through the poles. Also, the "
"Moon and Sun lie outside the Earth's Equatorial plane. As a result, the "
"gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun on the oblate Earth induces a slight "
"<emphasis>torque</emphasis> in addition to a linear force. This torque on the "
"spinning body of the Earth leads to the precessional motion."

"Precession is easiest to see by observing the <link linkend=\"ai-cpoles\">"
"Celestial Pole</link>. To find the pole, first switch to Equatorial Coordinates "
"in the <guilabel>Configure &kstars;</guilabel> window, and then hold down the "
"<keycap>Up arrow</keycap> key until the display stops scrolling. The "
"declination displayed in the center of the <guilabel>Info Panel</guilabel> "
"should be +90 degrees, and the bright star Polaris should be nearly at the "
"center of the screen. Try slewing with the left and right arrow keys. Notice "
"that the sky appears to rotate around the Pole."

"We will now demonstrate Precession by changing the Date to a very remote year, "
"and observing that the location of the Celestial Pole is no longer near "
"Polaris. Open the <guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window (<keycombo "
"action=\"simul\">&Ctrl;<keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>"
"), and set the date to the year 8000 (currently, &kstars; cannot handle dates "
"much more remote than this, but this date is sufficient for our purposes). "
"Notice that the sky display is now centered at a point between the "
"constellations Cygnus and Cepheus. Verify that this is actually the pole by "
"slewing left and right: the sky rotates about this point; in the year 8000, the "
"North celestial pole will no longer be near Polaris."
