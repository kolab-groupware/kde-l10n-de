"A basic requirement for studying the heavens is determining where in the sky "
"things are. To specify sky positions, astronomers have developed several "
"<firstterm>coordinate systems</firstterm>. Each uses a coordinate grid "
"projected on the <link linkend=\"ai-csphere\">Celestial Sphere</link>"
", in analogy to the <link linkend=\"ai-geocoords\">Geographic coordinate "
"system</link> used on the surface of the Earth. The coordinate systems differ "
"only in their choice of the <firstterm>fundamental plane</firstterm>"
", which divides the sky into two equal hemispheres along a <link "
"linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">great circle</link>. (the fundamental plane of the "
"geographic system is the Earth's equator). Each coordinate system is named for "
"its choice of fundamental plane."

"The <firstterm>Equatorial coordinate system</firstterm> "
"is probably the most widely used celestial coordinate system. It is also the "
"most closely related to the <link linkend=\"ai-geocoords\">"
"Geographic coordinate system</link>, because they use the same fundamental "
"plane, and the same poles. The projection of the Earth's equator onto the "
"celestial sphere is called the <link linkend=\"ai-cequator\">"
"Celestial Equator</link>. Similarly, projecting the geographic Poles onto the "
"celestial sphere defines the North and South <link linkend=\"ai-cpoles\">"
"Celestial Poles</link>."

"The <firstterm>latitudinal</firstterm> (latitude-like) angle of the Equatorial "
"system is called <firstterm>Declination</firstterm> (Dec for short). It "
"measures the angle of an object above or below the Celestial Equator. The "
"<firstterm>longitudinal</firstterm> angle is called the <firstterm>"
"Right Ascension</firstterm> (<acronym>RA</acronym> for short). It measures the "
"angle of an object East of the <link linkend=\"ai-equinox\">"
"Vernal Equinox</link>. Unlike longitude, Right Ascension is usually measured in "
"hours instead of degrees, because the apparent rotation of the Equatorial "
"coordinate system is closely related to <link linkend=\"ai-sidereal\">"
"Sidereal Time</link> and <link linkend=\"ai-hourangle\">Hour Angle</link>"
". Since a full rotation of the sky takes 24 hours to complete, there are (360 "
"degrees / 24 hours) = 15 degrees in one Hour of Right Ascension."

"The equatorial coordinates for deep-sky objects and stars do not vary "
"appreciably over short durations of time, since they are not affected by the "
"<firstterm>diurnal motion</firstterm> (the daily apparent rotation of the sky "
"around the earth. However, note that this takes <link linkend=\"ai-sidereal\">"
"1 sidereal day</link>, as against 1 solar day). They are suitable coordinates "
"for making catalogs of stars and deep-sky objects (note that <firstterm>"
"Galactic Coordinates</firstterm> also work well, but are cumbersome to use from "
"an earth point-of-view). However, there are effects that cause the RA and Dec "
"of objects to vary over time, namely <link linkend=\"ai-precession\">"
"Precession</link> and <firstterm>nutation</firstterm>, and <firstterm>"
"proper motion</firstterm>, the latter being even less important. Equatorial "
"coordinates are thus generally specified with an appropriate <link "
"linkend=\"ai-epoch\">epoch</link>, to account for precession. Popular epochs "
"include J2000.0 (<link linkend=\"ai-julianday\">Julian Year</link> "
"2000) and B1950.0 (<firstterm>Besselian Year</firstterm> 1950)."
