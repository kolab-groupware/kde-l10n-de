"Stars appear to be exclusively white at first glance. But if we look carefully, "
"we can notice a range of colors: blue, white, red, and even gold. In the winter "
"constellation of Orion, a beautiful contrast is seen between the red Betelgeuse "
"at Orion's \"armpit\" and the blue Bellatrix at the shoulder. What causes stars "
"to exhibit different colors remained a mystery until two centuries ago, when "
"Physicists gained enough understanding of the nature of light and the "
"properties of matter at immensely high temperatures."

"Specifically, it was the physics of <link linkend=\"ai-blackbody\">"
"blackbody radiation</link> that enabled us to understand the variation of "
"stellar colors. Shortly after blackbody radiation was understood, it was "
"noticed that the spectra of stars look extremely similar to blackbody radiation "
"curves of various temperatures, ranging from a few thousand Kelvin to ~50,000 "
"Kelvin. The obvious conclusion is that stars are similar to blackbodies, and "
"that the color variation of stars is a direct consequence of their surface "
"temperatures."

"Cool stars (i.e., Spectral Type K and M) radiate most of their energy in the "
"red and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus appear red, "
"while hot stars (i.e., Spectral Type O and B) emit mostly at blue and "
"ultra-violet wavelengths, making them appear blue or white."

"To estimate the surface temperature of a star, we can use the known "
"relationship between the temperature of a blackbody, and the wavelength of "
"light where its spectrum peaks. That is, as you increase the temperature of a "
"blackbody, the peak of its spectrum moves to shorter (bluer) wavelengths of "
"light. This is illustrated in Figure 1 where the intensity of three "
"hypothetical stars is plotted against wavelength. The \"rainbow\" indicates the "
"range of wavelengths that are visible to the human eye."

"This simple method is conceptually correct, but it cannot be used to obtain "
"stellar temperatures accurately, because stars are <emphasis>not</emphasis> "
"perfect blackbodies. The presence of various elements in the star's atmosphere "
"will cause certain wavelengths of light to be absorbed. Because these "
"absorption lines are not uniformly distributed over the spectrum, they can skew "
"the position of the spectral peak. Moreover, obtaining a usable spectrum of a "
"star is a time-intensive process and is prohibitively inefficient for large "
"samples of stars."

"An alternative method utilizes photometry to measure the intensity of light "
"passing through different filters. Each filter allows <emphasis>only</emphasis> "
"a specific part of the spectrum of light to pass through while rejecting all "
"others. A widely used photometric system is called the <firstterm>"
"Johnson UBV system</firstterm>. It employs three bandpass filters: U "
"(\"Ultra-violet\"), B (\"Blue\"), and V (\"Visible\"); each occupying different "
"regions of the electromagnetic spectrum."

"The process of UBV photometry involves using light sensitive devices (such as "
"film or CCD cameras) and aiming a telescope at a star to measure the intensity "
"of light that passes through each of the filters individually. This procedure "
"gives three apparent brightnesses or <link linkend=\"ai-flux\">fluxes</link> "
"(amount of energy per cm<superscript>2</superscript> "
"per second) designated by Fu, Fb, and Fv. The ratio of fluxes Fu/Fb and Fb/Fv "
"is a quantitative measure of the star's \"color\", and these ratios can be used "
"to establish a temperature scale for stars. Generally speaking, the larger the "
"Fu/Fb and Fb/Fv ratios of a star, the hotter its surface temperature."

"For example, the star Bellatrix in Orion has Fb/Fv = 1.22, indicating that it "
"is brighter through the B filter than through the V filter. furthermore, its "
"Fu/Fb ratio is 2.22, so it is brightest through the U filter. This indicates "
"that the star must be very hot indeed, since the position of its spectral peak "
"must be somewhere in the range of the U filter, or at an even shorter "
"wavelength. The surface temperature of Bellatrix (as determined from comparing "
"its spectrum to detailed models that account for its absorption lines) is about "
"25,000 Kelvin."

"We can repeat this analysis for the star Betelgeuse. Its Fb/Fv and Fu/Fb ratios "
"are 0.15 and 0.18, respectively, so it is brightest in V and dimmest in U. So, "
"the spectral peak of Betelgeuse must be somewhere in the range of the V filter, "
"or at an even longer wavelength. The surface temperature of Betelgeuse is only "
"2,400 Kelvin."
