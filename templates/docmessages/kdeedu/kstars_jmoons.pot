"This tool displays the positions of Jupiter's four largest moons (Io, Europa, "
"Ganymede, and Callisto) relative to Jupiter, as a function of time. Time is "
"plotted vertically; the units are days and <quote>time=0.0</quote> "
"corresponds to the current simulation time. The horizontal axis displays the "
"angular offset from Jupiter's position, in arcminutes. The offset is measured "
"along the direction of Jupiter's equator. Each moon's position as a function of "
"time traces a sinusoidal path in the plot, as the moon orbits around Jupiter. "
"Each track is assigned a different color to distinguish it from the others; the "
"name labels at the top of the window indicate the color used by each moon."

"The plot can be manipulated with the keyboard. The time axis can be expanded or "
"compressed using the <keycap>+</keycap> and <keycap>-</keycap> "
"keys. The time displayed at the center of the window can be changed with the "
"<keycap>[</keycap> and <keycap>]</keycap> keys."
