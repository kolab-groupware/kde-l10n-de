"<firstterm>Stars</firstterm> are gigantic, self-gravitating spheres of (mostly) "
"Hydrogen gas. Stars are also thermonuclear engines; nuclear fusion takes place "
"deep in the cores of stars, where the density is extreme and the temperature "
"reaches tens of millions of degrees Celsius."

"Yes, the Sun is a star. It is the dominant centerpiece of our solar system. "
"Compared to other stars, our Sun is rather ordinary; it appears to be so much "
"bigger and brighter to us because it is millions of times closer than any other "
"star."

"The short answer is: star shine because they are very hot. It is really no more "
"complicated than that. Any object heated to thousands of degrees will radiate "
"light, just like stars do."

"This is a tougher question. The usual answer is that stars get their heat from "
"the thermonuclear fusion reactions in their cores. However, this cannot be the "
"ultimate cause for the stars' heat, because a star must be hot in the first "
"place for nuclear fusion to be triggered. Fusion can only sustain the hot "
"temperature; it cannot make a star hot. A more correct answer is that stars are "
"hot because they have collapsed. Stars form from diffuse gaseous nebulae; as "
"the nebulous gas condenses to form a star, the gravitational potential energy "
"of the material is released, first as kinetic energy, and ultimately as heat as "
"the density increases."

"Stars have many things in common: they are all collapsed spheres of hot, dense "
"gas (mostly Hydrogen), and nuclear fusion reactions are occurring at or near "
"the centers of every star in the sky."

"However, stars also show a great diversity in some properties. The brightest "
"stars shine almost 100 million times as brightly as the faintest stars. Stars "
"range in surface temperature from only a few thousand degrees to almost 50,000 "
"degrees Celsius. These differences are largely due to differences in mass: "
"massive stars are both hotter and brighter than lower-mass stars. The "
"temperature and Luminosity also depend on the <emphasis>"
"evolutionary state</emphasis> of the star."

"(not including protostar phases). What happens to a star after it runs out of "
"core Hydrogen is addressed in the stellar evolution article (coming soon)."

"The lifetime of a star depends very much on its mass. More massive stars are "
"hotter and shine much more brightly, causing them to consume their nuclear fuel "
"much more rapidly. The largest stars (roughly 100 times as massive as the Sun), "
"will run out of fuel in only a few million years; while the smallest stars "
"(roughly ten percent the mass of the Sun), with their much more frugal "
"consumption rate, will shine on (albeit dimly) for <emphasis>"
"trillions</emphasis> of years. Note that this is much longer than the Universe "
"has yet been in existence."
