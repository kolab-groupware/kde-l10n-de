"A <firstterm>blackbody</firstterm> refers to an opaque object that emits "
"<firstterm>thermal radiation</firstterm>. A perfect blackbody is one that "
"absorbs all incoming light and does not reflect any. At room temperature, such "
"an object would appear to be perfectly black (hence the term <emphasis>"
"blackbody</emphasis>). However, if heated to a high temperature, a blackbody "
"will begin to glow with <firstterm>thermal radiation</firstterm>."

"In fact, all objects emit thermal radiation (as long as their temperature is "
"above Absolute Zero, or -273.15 degrees Celsius), but no object emits thermal "
"radiation perfectly; rather, they are better at emitting/absorbing some "
"wavelengths of light than others. These uneven efficiencies make it difficult "
"to study the interaction of light, heat and matter using normal objects."

"Fortunately, it is possible to construct a nearly-perfect blackbody. Construct "
"a box made of a thermally conductive material, such as metal. The box should be "
"completely closed on all sides, so that the inside forms a cavity that does not "
"receive light from the surroundings. Then, make a small hole somewhere on the "
"box. The light coming out of this hole will almost perfectly resemble the light "
"from an ideal blackbody, for the temperature of the air inside the box."

"At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists Lord Rayleigh, and Max Planck "
"(among others) studied the blackbody radiation using such a device. After much "
"work, Planck was able to empirically describe the intensity of light emitted by "
"a blackbody as a function of wavelength. Furthermore, he was able to describe "
"how this spectrum would change as the temperature changed. Planck's work on "
"blackbody radiation is one of the areas of physics that led to the foundation "
"of the wonderful science of Quantum Mechanics, but that is unfortunately beyond "
"the scope of this article."

"What Planck and the others found was that as the temperature of a blackbody "
"increases, the total amount of light emitted per second increases, and the "
"wavelength of the spectrum's peak shifts to bluer colors (see Figure 1)."

"In 1893, German physicist Wilhelm Wien quantified the relationship between "
"blackbody temperature and the wavelength of the spectral peak with the "
"following equation:"

"where T is the temperature in Kelvin. Wien's law (also known as Wien's "
"displacement law) states that the wavelength of maximum emission from a "
"blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. This makes sense; "
"shorter-wavelength (higher-frequency) light corresponds to higher-energy "
"photons, which you would expect from a higher-temperature object."
