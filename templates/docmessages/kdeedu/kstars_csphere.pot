"The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius, centered on the "
"Earth. All objects which can be seen in the sky can be thought of as lying on "

"Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not on the surface of a "
"sphere centered on the Earth, so why bother with such a construct? Everything "
"we see in the sky is so very far away, that their distances are impossible to "
"gauge just by looking at them. Since their distances are indeterminate, you "
"only need to know the <emphasis>direction</emphasis> "
"toward the object to locate it in the sky. In this sense, the celestial sphere "
"model is a very practical model for mapping the sky."
