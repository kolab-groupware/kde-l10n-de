"The ecliptic is an imaginary <link linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">"
"Great Circle</link> on the <link linkend=\"ai-csphere\">Celestial Sphere</link> "
"along which the Sun appears to move over the course of a year. Of course, it is "
"really the Earth's orbit around the Sun causing the change in the Sun's "
"apparent direction. The ecliptic is inclined from the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-cequator\">Celestial Equator</link> by 23.5 degrees. The two "
"points where the Ecliptic crosses the Celestial Equator are known as the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-equinox\">Equinoxes</link>."

"Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the planets are also "
"close to the plane of the ecliptic. In addition, the constellations of the "
"zodiac are located along the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very useful "
"line of reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the "
"constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally <quote>"
"follow the Sun</quote>."

"Because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Ecliptic, the <firstterm>"
"Altitude</firstterm> of the Sun at noon changes over the course of the year, as "
"it follows the path of the Ecliptic across the sky. This causes the seasons. In "
"the Summer, the Sun is high in the sky at noon, and it remains above the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-horizon\">Horizon</link> for more than twelve hours. Whereas, in "
"the winter, the Sun is low in the sky at noon, and remains above the Horizon "
"for less than twelve hours. In addition, sunlight is received at the Earth's "
"surface at a more direct angle in the Summer, which means that a given area at "
"the surface receives more energy per second in the Summer than in Winter. The "
"differences in day duration and in energy received per unit area lead to the "
"differences in temperature we experience in Summer and Winter."

"Make sure your location is set to somewhere that is not very near the equator "
"for these experiments. Open the <guilabel>Configure &kstars;</guilabel> "
"window, and switch to Horizontal coordinates, with the Opaque Ground shown. "
"Open the <guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window (<keycombo action=\"simul\">"
"&Ctrl;<keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>),and change the Date to sometime in the "
"middle of Summer, and the Time to 12:00 Noon. Back in the Main Window, point "
"toward the Southern Horizon (press <keycap>S</keycap>"
"). Note the height of the Sun above the Horizon at Noon in the Summer. Now, "
"change the Date to something in the middle of Winter (but keep the Time at "
"12:00 Noon). The Sun is now much lower in the Sky. You will also notice that "
"the day durations are different if you open the <guilabel>"
"What's Up Tonight?</guilabel> tool for each date."
