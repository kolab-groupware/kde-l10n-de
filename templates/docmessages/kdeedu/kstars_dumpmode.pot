"By default, &kstars; will read in the options values stored in your <filename>"
"$KDEHOME/share/config/kstarsrc</filename> file to determine where the image "
"will be centered, and how it is rendered. This means you need to run &kstars; "
"in normal GUI mode, and exit the program when it is set up with the desired "
"options for the generated images. This is not very flexible, so we also provide "
"the ability to execute a &kstars; &DBus; script to set the scene before "
"generating the image. The filename you specify as the script argument should be "
"a valid &kstars; &DBus; script, such as one created with the <link "
"linkend=\"tool-scriptbuilder\">Script Builder Tool</link>"
". The script can be used to set where the image is pointing, set the geographic "
"location, set the time and date, change the Zoom level, and adjust other view "
"options. Some of the &DBus; functions make no sense in non-GUI mode (such as "
"<function>waitForKey()</function>); if these functions are encountered while "
"parsing the script, they are simply ignored."

"By default, &kstars; will use the system CPU time and date for generating the "

"--date</quote> argument. You can also use this argument for specifying the "
"startup date in normal GUI mode."
