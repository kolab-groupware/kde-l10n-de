"The Earth has two major components of motion. First, it spins on its rotational "
"axis; a full spin rotation takes one <firstterm>Day</firstterm> "
"to complete. Second, it orbits around the Sun; a full orbital rotation takes "
"one <firstterm>Year</firstterm> to complete."

"There are normally 365 days in one <emphasis>calendar</emphasis> "
"year, but it turns out that a <emphasis>true</emphasis> "
"year (&ie;, a full orbit of the Earth around the Sun; also called a <firstterm>"
"tropical year</firstterm>) is a little bit longer than 365 days. In other "
"words, in the time it takes the Earth to complete one orbital circuit, it "
"completes 365.24219 spin rotations. Do not be too surprised by this; there is "
"no reason to expect the spin and orbital motions of the Earth to be "
"synchronized in any way. However, it does make marking calendar time a bit "
"awkward...."

"What would happen if we simply ignored the extra 0.24219 rotation at the end of "
"the year, and simply defined a calendar year to always be 365.0 days long? The "
"calendar is basically a charting of the Earth's progress around the Sun. If we "
"ignore the extra bit at the end of each year, then with every passing year, the "
"calendar date lags a little more behind the true position of Earth around the "
"Sun. In just a few decades, the dates of the solstices and equinoxes will have "
"drifted noticeably."

"In fact, it used to be that all years <emphasis>were</emphasis> "

"away from the true seasons as a result. In the year 46 <abbrev>BCE</abbrev>"
", Julius Caeser established the <firstterm>Julian Calendar</firstterm>"
", which implemented the world's first <firstterm>leap years</firstterm>"
": He decreed that every 4th year would be 366 days long, so that a year was "
"365.25 days long, on average. This basically solved the calendar drift problem."

"However, the problem wasn't completely solved by the Julian calendar, because a "
"tropical year isn't 365.25 days long; it's 365.24219 days long. You still have "
"a calendar drift problem, it just takes many centuries to become noticeable. "
"And so, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the <firstterm>"
"Gregorian calendar</firstterm>, which was largely the same as the Julian "
"Calendar, with one more trick added for leap years: even Century years (those "
"ending with the digits <quote>00</quote>) are only leap years if they are "
"divisible by 400. So, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years "
"(though they would have been under the Julian Calendar), whereas the year 2000 "
"<emphasis>was</emphasis> a leap year. This change makes the average length of a "
"year 365.2425 days. So, there is still a tiny calendar drift, but it amounts to "
"an error of only 3 days in 10,000 years. The Gregorian calendar is still used "
"as a standard calendar throughout most of the world."

"Fun Trivia: When Pope Gregory instituted the Gregorian Calendar, the Julian "
"Calendar had been followed for over 1500 years, and so the calendar date had "
"already drifted by over a week. Pope Gregory re-synchronized the calendar by "
"simply <emphasis>eliminating</emphasis> 10 days: in 1582, the day after October "
"4th was October 15th!"
