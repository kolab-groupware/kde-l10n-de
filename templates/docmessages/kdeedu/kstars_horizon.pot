"The <firstterm>Horizon</firstterm> is the line that separates Earth from Sky. "
"More precisely, it is the line that divides all of the directions you can "
"possibly look into two categories: those which intersect the Earth, and those "
"which do not. At many locations, the Horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, "
"mountains, &etc; However, if you are on a ship at sea, the Horizon is "
"strikingly apparent."

". In other words, it is the locus of points which have an <firstterm>"
"Altitude</firstterm> of zero degrees."
