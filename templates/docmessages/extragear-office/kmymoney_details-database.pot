"As of release 1.0, &kappname; allows you to hold your data in a relational "
"database. One of the advantages of using this industry-standard format is that "
"it may allow you to view your data using one of the graphic front ends such as "
"OpenOffice.org<trademark class=\"copyright\"></trademark> "
"or LibreOffice<trademark class=\"copyright\"></trademark>"
", perhaps in some format that &kappname; currently doesn't provide. Also, a "
"little knowledge of SQL (Structured Query Language, the language used "
"world-wide to access relational databases) should enable you more easily to "
"export data to an external program, for example, a budgeting application."

"To access the database, &kappname; uses the SQL module supplied by &Qt; "
"Software as part of their &Qt; programming system. This module supports a "
"number of different database systems through a collection of drivers. Among the "
"more popular open-source systems for which drivers are available are "
"MySQL<trademark class=\"registered\"></trademark>, SQLite (version 3 and "

"&kappname;, 'your' machine acts as both client and server. Your first task "
