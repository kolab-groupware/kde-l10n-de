"As a personal finance manager, &kappname; is not intended to scale to the needs "
"of an average business. A small business might find sufficient functionality to "
"use &kappname;, but features such as accounts-receivable and accounts-payable "
"are not directly supported. However, it would be possible to create client, "
"supplier, document, or other features through plugins."

"&kappname; is not simply a clone of the commercially available personal finance "
"programs. Although many of the features present in &kappname; can be found in "
"other similar applications, &kappname; strives to present an individual and "
"unique view of your finances."
