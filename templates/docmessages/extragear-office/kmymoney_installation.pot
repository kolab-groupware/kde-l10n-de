"&kappname; has existed for a number of years, and we have worked very hard on "
"full integration into &kde;. The earliest stable versions (1.0.x) required "
"libraries from &kde; 3, and so were not available in many Linux distributions, "
"which had already migrated to &kde; 4. However, with the release of version 4.5 "
"in August 2010, &kappname; could be easily compiled and installed on any "
"version of &kde; 4.3 or higher. The current version, 4.7, requires &kde; 4.6, "
"specifically kdelibs and kdepimlibs."

"Although work has begun porting &kappname; to the new KDE Frameworks 5, this is "

"version, which we expect to release in early 2015. Until then, if you are "
"specifically interested in following this work, you should subscribe to the "
"developers mailing list &devlist;."

"the release a new version of &kappname; for all the distributions to add it to "
