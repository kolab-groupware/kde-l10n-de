"The Authorization Agent is the application that is called whenever an user "
"wants to obtain a given authorization. It's a &DBus; activated daemon which "
"uses <quote>libpolkit-grant</quote> that in turn uses PAM for authentication "
"services (however, other authentication back-ends can be plugged in as "
"required)."

"The appearance of the authentication dialog depends on the result from "
"PolicyKit and also whether administrator authentication is defined as <quote>"
"authenticate as the root user</quote> or <quote>authenticate as one of the "
"users from UNIX group wheel</quote> or however the PolicyKit library is "
"configured (see the PolicyKit.conf(5) manual page for details). Note that some "
"of the screenshots below were made on a system set up to use the <ulink "
"url=\"http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net/\">ThinkFinger</ulink> "
"PAM module. The text shown in the authentication dialogs stems from the "
"PolicyKit .policy XML files residing in /usr/share/PolicyKit/policy and is read "
"by the authentication daemon when an applications asks to obtain an "
"authorization. Thus, what the user sees is not under application control (e.g. "
"it's not passed from the application) which rules out a class of attacks where "
"applications are trying to fool the user into gaining a privilege."
