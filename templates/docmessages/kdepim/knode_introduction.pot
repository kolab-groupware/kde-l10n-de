"For those new to reading news and posting articles, the <link "
"linkend=\"knode-journey\">A journey through Usenet</link> "
"chapter is recommended; it is not so much about &knode; as how to move about in "
"the Usenet with its help. In general, it is not sufficient to just master a "
"news reader for writing news articles: imagine a car driver who masters his car "
"perfectly but does not know about the traffic rules or signs; do you want to "
"encounter such a driver when out in traffic? So please take your time to learn "
"at least a little about the <quote>traffic rules</quote> "
"of the Usenet; the other participants will thank you."
