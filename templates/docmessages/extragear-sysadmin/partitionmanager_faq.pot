"&partman; can only show progress information when it knows how long the jobs in "
"an operation will take. Unfortunately this is usually not the case when "
"resizing partitions because the by far longest job when doing so is resizing "
"the file system on the partition. Resizing file systems is in most cases "
"something an external tool will do on behalf of &partman; and these external "
"tools do not provide useful progress information to &partman;, so there's "
"nothing to report while they are running."

"It is however not recommended to add too many operations to the list. There is "

"LibParted, a backend library &partman; uses, has problems with systems where "
"the Linux Device Mapper is used in a way it doesn't understand. Unfortunately "
"it reacts to some of these situations with segmentation faults, i.e. crashes. "
"&partman; therefore tries to avoid these situations by using an alternative way "
"to scan your computer for disks. If it cannot do that, however, and therefore "
"has to rely on LibParted, it will print a message like the one mentioned. If "
"the scanning for disks works, you can safely disregard the message."
