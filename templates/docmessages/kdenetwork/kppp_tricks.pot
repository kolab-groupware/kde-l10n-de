"One reason you might want to send the modem commands directly is if you have a "
"set of modem configurations you want to keep, and not have to specify for every "
"connection. A good way to do that is via modem profiles. Modems can have "
"several stored profiles numbered 0,1,... <command>AT&amp;V</command> "
"can be used to view them all. The default profile is usually 0 (this can be "
"changed via <command>AT&amp;Y</command>.) The profile currently in use is "

"Sometimes you may find that &kppp; has difficulties hanging up the modem. This "

"modem. A standard modem uses two methods to decide to hangup: <link "
"linkend=\"hangup-command-method\">Command</link>, and <link "
"linkend=\"hangup-dtr-method\"><acronym>DTR</acronym></link>"
