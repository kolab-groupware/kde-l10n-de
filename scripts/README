This directory contains scripts used to handle localization of programs and
manuals for KDE

Most of the scripts are used internally so you will probably never have to use
them, there are a few exceptions listed below:

 - autogen.sh: Used to generate the buildsystem of a given language. See README
               of the toplevel root for how to use it

 - find_po_without_pot.sh: Used for housekeeping, it will give you a list of
                           po that do not have a matching template. If a
                           language code is used as parameter it will give only
                           the report for the given language, otherwise it will
                           report about all languages. It has to be run 
                           from the toplevel root.
 
 - update_xml: Used to generate the documentation docbooks from the
               documentation .po files. It has to be run from the toplevel root.
               It has a mandatory parameter that is the language code and an
               optional parameter that is the module. If no module is given
               all the docbooks are rebuilt, if a module is given, only the
               docbooks of that module are rebuilt.
