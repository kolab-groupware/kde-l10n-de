how to tell scripty about a move to git:

0) make sure the translators are aware of and ready for your move.

1) on gitorious, give the kde-developers group commit access to your repository (scripty's in this group).

2) edit l10n-kde4/scripts/get_paths:

a) add your module to the list in list_modules (eg. extragear-multimedia_amarok)

b) add your module to get_path, before any *)
example:
    extragear-multimedia_amarok)
        echo git-unstable/extragear-multimedia_amarok
        ;;

c) add your module to get_po_path before any *)
example:
	extragear-multimedia_amarok)
		echo extragear-multimedia
		;;

d) add your module to get_vcs before any *)
example:
	extragear-multimedia_amarok)
		echo git
		;;

e) add your trunk-equivalent branch to get_branch before any *)
example:
	extragear-multimedia_amarok)
		echo master
		;;

f) add your git url to get_url before any *)
example:
	extragear-multimedia_amarok)
		echo "git@gitorious.org:amarok/amarok.git"
		;;

3) commit changes and pray that it works ;)

oh, and remember that your docbook folder must stay in svn for translation.

also remember to update the stable version of scripty when the newly-moved project has a stable release in git.


if something goes wrong on the pull, scripty will abort, which is bad. in
order to fix that I need to redesign findfiles to work on one module at a time.
