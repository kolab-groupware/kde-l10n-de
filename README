What it is
----------

Do you wonder what l10n stands for?  Just count the letters between the
first L and the last N in the word "localization" ...

requirements
------------

The *.po files contained in the subdirectories use a new message context
feature and kde-format flags, available in Gettext 0.17 and newer.
If your Gettext version is too old, you'll receive an error message in KBabel 
when saving a file and Catalogmanager will display a question mark on those 
files, which contain the new keyword "msgctxt". To avoid those annoying error 
messages in KBabel and Catalogmanager translators have two options:

  Option 1: Disable two checks in catalogmanager:
            - Project -> Configure -> Save ->    Check syntax of file when saving
            - Project -> Configure -> Folders -> Run msgfmt before processing a file

  Option 2: Install Gettext 0.17 or newer

language directories
--------------------

For every KDE supported language there is one directory that contains *.po
files as well as translated documentation files (*.docbook). To enjoy the
translated programs and languages, one has to install the files from the
respective directory and select Control Center -> Personalization -> Country
& Language -> Language.

As long as no locale is installed, all programs and documentation appear in
American English.

You don't need to install all locales, just select the directory you want.

To compile and install a language, for instance "de":

  ./scripts/autogen.sh de
  mkdir de-build
  cd de-build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR ../de
  make
  su -c "make install"

template directory
------------------

The template directory contains templates that only translators might use. Please
have a look at the KBabel program from the kdesdk package for further information.
