"<firstterm>Luminosity</firstterm> is the amount of energy emitted by a star "

"All stars radiate light over a broad range of frequencies in the "
"electromagnetic spectrum from the low energy radio waves up to the highly "
"energetic gamma rays. A star that emits predominately in the ultra-violet "
"region of the spectrum produces a total amount of energy magnitudes larger than "
"that produced in a star that emits principally in the infrared. Therefore, "
"luminosity is a measure of energy emitted by a star over all wavelengths. The "
"relationship between wavelength and energy was quantified by Einstein as E = h "
"* v where v is the frequency, h is the Planck constant, and E is the photon "
"energy in joules. That is, shorter wavelengths (and thus higher frequencies) "
"correspond to higher energies."

"For example, a wavelength of lambda = 10 meter lies in the radio region of the "
"electromagnetic spectrum and has a frequency of f = c / lambda = 3 * "
"10<superscript>8</superscript> m/s / 10 = 30 MHz where c is the speed of light. "
"The energy of this photon is E = h * v = 6.625 * 10<superscript>"
"-34</superscript> J s * 30 Mhz = 1.988 * 10<superscript>-26</superscript> "
"joules. On the other hand, visible light has much shorter wavelengths and "
"higher frequencies. A photon that has a wavelength of lambda = 5 * "
"10<superscript>-9</superscript> meters (A greenish photon) has an energy E = "
"3.975 * 10<superscript>-17</superscript> joules which is over a billion times "
"higher than the energy of a radio photon. Similarly, a photon of red light "
"(wavelength lambda = 700 nm) has less energy than a photon of violet light "
"(wavelength lambda = 400 nm)."

"Luminosity depends both on temperature and surface area. This makes sense "
"because a burning log radiates more energy than a match, even though both have "
"the same temperature. Similarly, an iron rod heated to 2000 degrees emits more "
"energy than when it is heated to only 200 degrees."

"Luminosity is a very fundamental quantity in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Much "
"of what is learnt about celestial objects comes from analyzing their light. "
"This is because the physical processes that occur inside stars gets recorded "
"and transmitted by light. Luminosity is measured in units of energy per second. "
"Astronomers prefer to use Ergs, rather than Watts, when quantifying luminosity."
