"&kbookmarkmerger; is a program for merging a given set of bookmarks into the "
"user's set of bookmarks; if the user doesn't have any bookmarks created yet, a "
"new bookmark list is created and the given bookmarks are inserted into it. "
"While doing this, &kbookmarkmerger; keeps track of which files were merged in a "
"previous run already, so no bookmark will get installed to the user's bookmarks "
"more than once. In case &kde; is running while &kbookmarkmerger; is executed, "
"the &kde; bookmark subsystem will be informed of any changes to the user's "
"bookmarks, so that all applications accessing that information (&ie; "
"&konqueror;) will pick the changes up instantly."

"The traditionally used approach to achieve something like this was to use "
"carefully crafted skeleton home directories when creating a new user account, "
"to provide the user with a standard set of bookmarks. The problem with this "
"approach is that after the user account has been created, no new bookmarks can "
"be propagated."

"This mechanism is useful for system administrators who want to propagate a "
"bookmark pointing to a certain document (for instance, important notes about "
"the system) to all users. Distributors might find it useful as well, for "
"instance by augmenting the software packages they supply with bookmark files "
"which &kbookmarkmerger; merges into the user's bookmark list when the package "
"is installed. That way, documentation shipped with a software package is easily "
"and visibly accessible right after the package has been installed."
