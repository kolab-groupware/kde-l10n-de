"KDE applications can be controlled externally from another program, from a "
"console prompt, or from a shell script using the Inter-process communication "
"protocol (&DBus;). &kstars; takes advantage of this feature to allow rather "
"complex behaviors to be scripted and played back at any time. This can be used, "

"The problem with &DBus; scripts is, writing them is a bit like programming, and "

"Script Builder Tool provides a <abbrev>GUI</abbrev> point-and-click interface "
"for constructing &kstars; &DBus; scripts, making it very easy to create complex "

"Function Arguments panel</firstterm>; when a function is highlighted in the "

"If we are going to track the Moon, we will need to point the display at it "

"The Function Arguments panel will now contain a combobox labeled <quote>"

"the Moon or any other objects. You can either enter <quote>Moon</quote> "
"in the box manually, or press the <guibutton>Object</guibutton> "
"button to use the <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window to select the Moon "
"from the list of named objects. Note that, as usual, centering on an object "

"Actually, we are not quite done yet. We should probably make sure that the "
"display is using Equatorial coordinates before the script tracks the Moon with "
"an accelerated time step. Otherwise, if the display is using Horizontal "
"coordinates, it will rotate very quickly through large angles as the Moon rises "
"and sets. This can be very confusing, and is avoided by setting the View Option "
"<firstterm>UseAltAz</firstterm> to <quote>false</quote>"
". To change any View Option, use the <firstterm>changeViewOption</firstterm> "
"function. Add this function to the script, and examine the Function Arguments "
"panel. There is a combobox which contains the list of all options which can be "
"adjusted by changeViewOption. Since we know we want the UseAltAz option, we "
"could simply select it from the combobox. However, the list is quite long, and "
"there is no explanation of what each item is for. It therefore may be easier to "
"press the <guibutton>Browse Tree</guibutton> button, which will open a window "
"containing a tree view of the available options, organized by topic. In "
"addition, each item has a short explanation of what the option does, and the "
"data type of the option's value. We find UseAltAz under the <guilabel>"
"Skymap options</guilabel> category. Just highlight this item and press "
"<guibutton>OK</guibutton>, and it will be selected in the combobox of the "
"Function Arguments panel. Finally, make its value <quote>false</quote> "
