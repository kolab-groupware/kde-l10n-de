"As explained in the <link linkend=\"ai-sidereal\">Sidereal Time</link> "
"article, the <firstterm>Right Ascension</firstterm> of an object indicates the "
"Sidereal Time at which it will transit across your <link "

"Hour Angle</firstterm> is defined as the difference between the current Local "
"Sidereal Time and the Right Ascension of the object:"

"Thus, the object's Hour Angle indicates how much Sidereal Time has passed since "
"the object was on the Local Meridian. It is also the angular distance between "
"the object and the meridian, measured in hours (1 hour = 15 degrees). For "
"example, if an object has an hour angle of 2.5 hours, it transited across the "
"Local Meridian 2.5 hours ago, and is currently 37.5 degrees West of the "
"Meridian. Negative Hour Angles indicate the time until the <emphasis>"
"next</emphasis> transit across the Local Meridian. Of course, an Hour Angle of "
"zero means the object is currently on the Local Meridian."
