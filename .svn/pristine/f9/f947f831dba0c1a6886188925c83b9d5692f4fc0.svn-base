"Reconciliation is the process of matching the transactions you have entered "
"into &kappname; with the transactions listed for that account by the "
"institution. This is most commonly done with the list of transactions in a "
"statement, be it a bank statement, credit card statement, loan statement, or "
"any other statement. It can also be done against an on-line listing of the "
"account, although this is less common. If any discrepancies are found, then "
"either you or the person who created the statement have made a mistake."
