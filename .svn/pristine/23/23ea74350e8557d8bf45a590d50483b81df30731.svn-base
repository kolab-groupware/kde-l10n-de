"Astronomers use flux to denote the apparent brightness of a celestial body. The "
"apparent brightness is defined as the amount of light received from a star "
"above the earth atmosphere passing through a unit area each second. Therefore, "
"the apparent brightness is simply the flux we receive from a star."

"The flux measures the <emphasis>rate of flow</emphasis> "
"of energy that passes through each cm<superscript>2</superscript> "
"(or any unit area) of an object's surface each second. The detected flux "
"depends on the distance from the source that radiates the energy. This is "
"because the energy has to spread over a volume of space before it reaches us. "
"Let us assume that we have an imaginary balloon that encloses a star. Each dot "
"on the balloon represents a unit of energy emitted from the star. Initially, "
"the dots in an area of one cm<superscript>2</superscript> "
"are in close proximity to each other and the flux (energy emitted per square "
"centimeter per second) is high. After a distance d, the volume and surface area "
"of the balloon increased causing the dots to <emphasis>spread away</emphasis> "
"from each. Consequently, the number of dots (or energy) enclosed in one "
"cm<superscript>2</superscript> has decreased as illustrated in Figure 1."

"The flux is inversely proportional to distance by a simple r<superscript>"
"2</superscript> relation. Therefore, if the distance is doubled, we receive "
"1/2<superscript>2</superscript> or 1/4th of the original flux. From a "
"fundamental standpoint, the flux is the <link linkend=\"ai-luminosity\">"

"where (4 * &pi; * R<superscript>2</superscript>) is the surface area of a "
"sphere (or a balloon!) with a radius R. Flux is measured in Watts/m<superscript>"
"2</superscript>/s or as commonly used by astronomers: Ergs/cm<superscript>"
"2</superscript>/s. For example, the luminosity of the sun is L = 3.90 * "
"10<superscript>26</superscript> W. That is, in one second the sun radiates 3.90 "
"* 10<superscript>26</superscript> joules of energy into space. Thus, the flux "
"we receive passing through one square centimeter from the sun at a distance of "
"one AU (1.496 * 10<superscript>13</superscript> cm) is:"
