"&kstars; can display light curves for variable stars from the observing program "
"of the <ulink url=\"http://www.aavso.org\">American Association of Variable "
"Star Observers</ulink> (<abbrev>AAVSO</abbrev>). This program monitors over "
"6,000 variable stars and consists of 10 million observations going back almost "
"a century. &kstars; downloads the very latest data directly from the <abbrev>"
"AAVSO</abbrev> database via the Internet, so a network connection is required "

"<firstterm>Variable stars</firstterm> are stars that change in brightness. A "
"<firstterm>light curve</firstterm> is a plot of a variable star's brightness "
"over time. By looking at a light curve you can see how the star has behaved in "
"the past and try to predict how it will behave in the future. Astronomers also "
"use this data to model astrophysical processes in the star. This important to "
"help us understand how stars work."

"<firstterm>Fainter than</firstterm>: Sometimes the star is too faint to be seen "
