"&kstars; is a graphical desktop planetarium for &kde;. It depicts an accurate "
"simulation of the night sky, including stars, constellations, star clusters, "
"nebulae, galaxies, all planets, the Sun, the Moon, comets and asteroids. You "
"can see the sky as it appears from any location on Earth, on any date. The user "
"interface is highly intuitive and flexible; the display can be panned and "
"zoomed with the mouse, and you can easily identify objects, and track their "
"motion across the sky. &kstars; includes many powerful features, yet the "
"interface is clean and simple, and fun to use."

"NGC, and IC catalogs), all planets, the Sun and Moon, hundreds of comets and "
