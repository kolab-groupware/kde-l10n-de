"A loan is an agreement under which a borrower receives money from a lender and "
"agrees to repay the money at some future date. &kappname; allows you to track "
"loans by which you, as borrower, borrow money from or, as lender, lend money to "
"someone else. Most individuals borrow more than they lend, so you will "
"generally be the borrower and a finance company will generally be the lender. "
