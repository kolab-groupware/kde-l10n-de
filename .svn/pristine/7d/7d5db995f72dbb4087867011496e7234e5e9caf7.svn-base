"The IMAP4rev1 protocol (Internet Message Access Protocol) allows access to "
"messages in mail folders on a server. Unlike POP3, which is designed to "
"download the mails and delete them from the server, the purpose of IMAP is to "
"store all mails on the server to be able to access these mails from everywhere. "
"Messages can be stored on the server, retrieved from there or moved between "
"folders."

"For example in &konqueror;, simply type "
"<userinput>imap://username@your.mail.server/</userinput> "
"to get your IMAP folders listed. You can then deal with the folders and mails "

"<ulink url=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2192.txt?number=2192\">RFC 2192</ulink>"
