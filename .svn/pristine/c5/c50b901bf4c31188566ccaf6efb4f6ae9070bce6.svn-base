"Julian Days are a way of reckoning the current date by a simple count of the "
"number of days that have passed since some remote, arbitrary date. This number "
"of days is called the <firstterm>Julian Day</firstterm>, abbreviated as <abbrev>"
"JD</abbrev>. The starting point, <abbrev>JD=0</abbrev>"
", is January 1, 4713 BC (or -4712 January 1, since there was no year '0'). "
"Julian Days are very useful because they make it easy to determine the number "
"of days between two events by simply subtracting their Julian Day numbers. Such "
"a calculation is difficult for the standard (Gregorian) calendar, because days "
"are grouped into months, which contain a variable number of days, and there is "
"the added complication of <link linkend=\"ai-leapyear\">Leap Years</link>."
