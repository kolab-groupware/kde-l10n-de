"Remote Frame Buffer (or <acronym>RFB</acronym> for short) is a simple protocol "
"for remote access to graphical user interfaces. It works at the frame-buffer "
"level, which roughly corresponds to the rendered screen image, which means that "
"it can be applied to all windowing systems (including X11, &MacOS; and "
"&Microsoft; &Windows;). Remote Frame Buffer applications exist for many "
"platforms, and can often be freely re-distributed."

"In the Remote Frame Buffer protocol, the application that runs on the machine "
"where the user sits (containing the display, keyboard and pointer) is called "
"the client. The application that runs on the machine where the framebuffer is "
"located (which is running the windowing system and applications that the user "
"is remotely controlling) is called the server. &krfb; is the &kde; server for "
"the Remote Frame Buffer protocol. &krdc; is the &kde; client for the Remote "
"Frame Buffer protocol."

"It takes a reasonable amount of network traffic to send an image of the "
