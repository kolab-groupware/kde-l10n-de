"and your personal plugins in <filename class=\"directory\">$<envar>HOME</envar>"

"To find plugins, &konqueror; will look in the folders specified in the "

"work on most operating systems. If you need to provide a new path, click the "
"<guibutton>New</guibutton> button; then you can either enter the new path in "
"the text edit box to the left, or choose a folder using the file dialog by "
"clicking the <guibutton>Open file</guibutton> icon. As scanning the folders can "
"take a little time, you might want to remove folders from the list where you "
"know that no plugins are installed: do this by selecting a folder and clicking "
"<guibutton>Remove</guibutton>. Using the <guibutton>Up</guibutton> "
"and <guibutton>Down</guibutton> buttons you can change the order in which "
"folders will be scanned by moving the selected folder up or down."
