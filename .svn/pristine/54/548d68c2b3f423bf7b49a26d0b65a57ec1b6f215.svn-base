"Traditional &kde; launch notification has taken another form, which you can "
"also enable and disable here. Normally when you start an application, it gets "
"an immediate entry in the taskbar, with the icon replaced by a spinning "
"hourglass to let you know something is happening. You can toggle this behavior "
"on and off with the <guilabel>Enable taskbar notification</guilabel> "
"checkbox, and when it's enabled, you can set a time in the <guilabel>"
"Startup indication timeout</guilabel> spinbox."

"Not all applications that you start will eventually show a window, or an entry "
"in the taskbar. Some of them, for example, are docked into the &kde; system "
"tray. Alternatively, it might be that you sent it off to a different virtual "
"desktop, and in the <guilabel>Filters</guilabel> section of the <ulink "
"url=\"help:/plasma-desktop/panel.html\"> <guilabel>Task Manager "
"Settings</guilabel></ulink> the option <guilabel>Only show tasks from the "
"current desktop</guilabel> is checked. Setting a timeout ensures that, even in "
"these cases, you can still get launch feedback, but also that it will go away "
"when the job is done."
