"Invented in Holland at the beginning of the 17th century, telescopes are the "
"tools used by astronomers and astrophysicists for their observations. With the "
"development of modern science, telescopes are nowadays used for observing in "
"all ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, inside and outside Earth's "
"atmosphere. Telescopes work by collecting light with a large surface aerie "
"called objective that makes the incoming light to converge. The final image "
"will be viewed by using an eyepiece."

"telescopes have smaller focal ratios, as they obtain brighter images in a "

"exposure time in order to obtain a bright image, which is why it is <quote>"

"<firstterm>Chromatic aberration</firstterm> is a feature of telescopes that use "
"lenses to converge the light. Mainly, the focal length of a lens is wavelength "
"dependent, which means that the focal point of blue light differs from that of "
"the red light. This results in a blurred image. The effect of chromatic "
"aberration can be diminished by adding correcting lenses into the system. "
"<firstterm>Spherical</firstterm> aberration may also be a problem for lenses, "
"resulting from their shape. Spheroid surfaces will not make the incoming light "
"to converge to a single point, which is why other optical surfaces like "
"paraboloids are preferred. Even by using them we aren't still out of trouble, "
"as coma aberration appears in this case. It results from the dependence of the "
"focal length on the angle between the direction of the incoming ray and the "
"optical axis of the system. Thus, images of points that lie off the optical "
"axis are elongated, rather than being simple points, as it would be normal."

"<firstterm>Reflecting Telescopes</firstterm>, on the other side, use mirrors "

"<firstterm>The Cassegrain</firstterm> telescope is similar to the Newtonian one "

"secondary mirror needs to be convex, as it is increasing the focal length of "
"the optical system. The primary mirror of a Cassegrain Telescope is a "
"paraboloid. By replacing it with a hyperboloid we obtain a Ritchey-Chretien "
"telescope. The advantage of using a <firstterm>Ritchey-Chretien</firstterm> "

"obtaining a long focal length useful in different fields of astronomy and "
"astrophysics, like spectroscopy to avoiding the usage of a massive instrument. "
"But there are also disadvantages in using a Coude telescope, because the more "
"mirrors are placed in the system, the less amount of light arrives at the "
"detector. This happens because by using Aluminum mirrors, only 80 % of the "
"incident light gets reflected."

"<firstterm>Catadioptrics</firstterm> are types of telescopes that use systems "

"catadioptric is the <firstterm>Schmidt-Cassegrain</firstterm> "
"telescope. It has the advantage of providing a large angle field of view. In "
"order to minimize coma, it uses a primary spheroidal mirror with a thin "
"correcting lens that removes spherical aberrations. The secondary mirror is "
"placed in the center of the correcting lens, reflecting light through a hole "
"made in the primary mirror. Not as famous as the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope "
"but common though is the <firstterm>Maksutov</firstterm> "
"telescope that also uses a correcting lens with the primary mirror, this time "

"For a detailed analysis of the sky, observations are also carried in other "
"regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Very popular and efficient are "
"<firstterm>radio telescopes</firstterm>, developed mostly in the last century. "
"A common problem for both radio and optical telescopes is the need for better "
"resolution. We can derive the resolution of a telescope by using Rayleigh "
"criterion, that states the resolving power is equal to the ratio of the "
"incoming wavelength to the diameter of the aperture (times 1.22 for circular "
"apertures). So for a good resolution we need a diameter as big as possible. The "
"biggest radio telescope in the world is the Arecibo telescope from Puerto Rico "
"that uses a huge dish of 305 m diameter. In order to solve the problem for "
"resolutions, astronomers have developed a new technique called interferometry. "
"The basic principal of interferometry is that by observing the same object with "
"two distinct telescopes we can obtain a final image by \"connecting\" the two "
"initial ones. Nowadays, the most efficient observatory that uses interferometry "
"is the Very Large Array located near Socorro, New Mexico. It uses 27 telescopes "
"placed in a \"Y\" shape, with 25 m aperture each. There also exists a technique "
"called Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) that allows astronomers to "
"resolve images over the size of continents. The biggest project of the century "
"in this domain is the building of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), "
"which will be using 66 telescopes placed in the Atacama desert of northern "
"Chile."
