"This project was started by Paul Hensgen as one of his University projects. The "
"original name of the application was <application>UML Modeller</application>"
". Paul did all the development until the end of 2001 when the program reached "

"Version 1.0 already offered a lot of functionality, but after the project had "
"been reviewed at Paul's University, other developers could join and they "
"started making valuable contributions to <application>UML Modeller</application>"
", like switching from a binary file format to an &XML; file, support for more "
"types of &UML; Diagrams, Code Generation and Code Import just to name a few."

"Paul had to retire from the development team in Summer 2002 but, as Free and "
"Open Source Software, the program continues to improve and evolve and is being "
"maintained by a group of developers from different parts of the world. In "
"September 2002 the project changed its name from <application>"
"&UML; Modeller</application>, to &umbrello;. There are several reasons for the "
"change of names, the most important ones being that just <quote>uml</quote> "
"&mdash; as it was commonly known &mdash; was a much too generic name and caused "
"problems with some distributions. The other important reason is that the "
"developers think <application>Umbrello</application> is a much cooler name."
