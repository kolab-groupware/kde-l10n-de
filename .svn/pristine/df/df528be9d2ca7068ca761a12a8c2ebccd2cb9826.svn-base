"&konqueror; instance can contain the data for multiple windows or tabs. Your "
"choice on the following radio buttons does not limit the number of windows you "
"can open at one time, but rather, how many instances of &konqueror; you can "

"<emphasis>Preloading</emphasis> refers to loading an instance of &konqueror; "
"into memory before a user asks to start &konqueror;. The positive effect of "
"this is that when a user asks &kde; to load &konqueror; the window appears "
"instantly because most of the application has been preloaded. The negative "
"effect is that this instance of &konqueror; uses memory that could be used by "
"other programs. By default, when a user closes &konqueror;, &kde; does not "
"close the instance. This means that the next time a user wants &konqueror; "
"loaded, it is nearly instantaneous again."
