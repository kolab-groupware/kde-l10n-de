"The time on our clocks is essentially a measurement of the current position of "
"the Sun in the sky, which is different for places at different Longitudes "
"because the Earth is round (see <link linkend=\"ai-timezones\">Time Zones</link>"

"However, it is sometimes necessary to define a global time, one that is the "
"same for all places on Earth. One way to do this is to pick a place on the "
"Earth, and adopt the Local Time at that place as the <firstterm>"
"Universal Time</firstterm>, abbreviated <abbrev>UT</abbrev>"
". (The name is a bit of a misnomer, since Universal Time has little to do with "
"the Universe. It would perhaps be better to think of it as <emphasis>"
"global time</emphasis>)."

"The geographic location chosen to represent Universal Time is Greenwich, "
"England. The choice is arbitrary and historical. Universal Time became an "
"important concept when European ships began to sail the wide open seas, far "
"from any known landmarks. A navigator could reckon the ship's longitude by "
"comparing the Local Time (as measured from the Sun's position) to the time back "
"at the home port (as kept by an accurate clock on board the ship). Greenwich "
"was home to England's Royal Observatory, which was charged with keeping time "
"very accurately, so that ships in port could re-calibrate their clocks before "
"setting sail."
