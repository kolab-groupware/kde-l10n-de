"<ulink url=\"http://www.icq.com/en.html\">ICQ</ulink> "
"is a proprietary instant messaging program, first developed by the Israeli "
"company Mirabilis. It uses AOL's OSCAR network protocol for sending the text "
"messages. To identify people, it uses a number, called UIN (Unified "
"Identification Number). If you register an ICQ account, you also have to enter "
"an e-mail address. Some ICQ clients support login with that e-mail address "
"instead of your UIN (but not &kopete;)."
