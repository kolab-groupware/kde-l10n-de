"The sky appears to drift overhead from east to west, completing a full circuit "
"around the sky in 24 (<link linkend=\"ai-sidereal\">Sidereal</link>"
") hours. This phenomenon is due to the spinning of the Earth on its axis. The "
"Earth's spin axis intersects the <link linkend=\"ai-csphere\">"
"Celestial Sphere</link> at two points. These points are the <firstterm>"
"Celestial Poles</firstterm>. As the Earth spins; they remain fixed in the sky, "
"and all other points seem to rotate around them. The celestial poles are also "
"the poles of the <link linkend=\"equatorial\">Equatorial Coordinate "
"System</link>, meaning they have <firstterm>Declinations</firstterm> "
"of +90 degrees and -90 degrees (for the North and South celestial poles, "
"respectively)."

"The North Celestial Pole currently has nearly the same coordinates as the "
"bright star <firstterm>Polaris</firstterm> (which is Latin for <quote>"
"Pole Star</quote>). This makes Polaris useful for navigation: not only is it "
"always above the North point of the horizon, but its <link "
"linkend=\"horizontal\">Altitude</link> angle is always (nearly) equal to the "
"observer's <link linkend=\"ai-geocoords\">Geographic Latitude</link> "
"(however, Polaris can only be seen from locations in the Northern hemisphere)."

"Use the <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window (<keycombo action=\"simul\">"

"Declination is almost (but not exactly) +90 degrees. Compare the Altitude "
"reading when focused on Polaris to your location's geographic latitude. They "
"are always within one degree of each other. They are not exactly the same "
"because Polaris isn't exactly at the Pole. (you can point exactly at the pole "
"by switching to Equatorial coordinates, and pressing the up-arrow key until the "
