"This tool displays a model of our solar system as seen from above. The Sun is "
"drawn as a yellow dot in the center of the plot, and the orbits of the planets "
"are drawn as ellipses with the correct shapes and orientations. The current "
"position of each planet along its orbit is drawn as a colored dot, along with a "
"name label. The display can be zoomed in and out with the <keycap>+</keycap> "
"and <keycap>-</keycap> keys, and the display can be recentered with the arrow "
"keys, or by double-clicking anywhere in the window with the mouse. You can also "
"center on a planet with the <keycap>0&ndash;9</keycap> keys (<keycap>0</keycap> "
"is the Sun; <keycap>9</keycap> is Pluto). If you center on a planet, it will be "
"tracked as time passes in the tool."

"The Solar System Viewer has its own clock, independent of the clock in the main "
"&kstars; window. There is a timestep control widget here, similar to the one in "
"the main window's toolbar. However, this control defaults to a timestep of 1 "
"day (so that the motions of the planets can be seen), and it starts out with "
"the clock paused when the tool is opened."

"The current model used for Pluto's orbit is only good for dates within about "
"100 years of the present date. If you let the Solar System clock advance beyond "
"this range, you will see Pluto behave very strangely! We are aware of this "
"issue, and will try to improve Pluto's orbit model soon."
