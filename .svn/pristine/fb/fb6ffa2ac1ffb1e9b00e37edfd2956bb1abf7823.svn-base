"This tool plots the altitude of any objects as a function of time, for any date "
"and location on Earth. The top section is a graphical plot of altitude angle on "
"the vertical axis, and time on the horizontal axis. The time is shown both as "
"standard local time along the bottom, and <link linkend=\"ai-sidereal\">"
"sidereal time</link> along the top. The bottom half of the graph is shaded "
"green to indicate that points in this region are below the horizon."

"There are a few ways to add curves to the plot. The simplest way to add the "
"curve of an existing object is to simply type its name in the <guilabel>"
"Name</guilabel> input field, and press Enter, or the <guibutton>Plot</guibutton> "
"button. If the text you enter is found in the object database, the object's "
"curve is added to the graph. You can also press the <guibutton>"
"Find Object</guibutton> button to open the <link linkend=\"findobjects\">"
"Find Object Window</link> to select an object from the list of known objects. "
"If you want to add a point that does not exist in the object database, simply "
"enter a name for the point, and then fill in the coordinates in the <guilabel>"
"RA</guilabel> and <guilabel>Dec</guilabel> input fields. Then press the "
"<guibutton>Plot</guibutton> button to add the curve for your custom object to "
"the plot (note that you have to pick a name that does not already exist in the "
"object database for this to work)."

"When you add an object to the plot, its altitude vs. time curve is plotted with "
"a thick white line, and its name is added to the listbox at the lower right. "
"Any objects that were already present are plotted with a thinner red curve. You "
"can choose which object is plotted with the thick white curve by highlighting "
"its name in the listbox."

"These curves show the objects' Altitude (angle above the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-horizon\">horizon</link>) as a function of time. When a curve "
"passes from the lower half to the upper half, the object has risen; when it "
"falls back to the lower half, it has set. For example, in the screenshot, the "
"minor planet <firstterm>Quaoar</firstterm> is setting at around 15:00 local "
"time, and is rising at about 04:00 local time."

"The Altitude of an object depends on both where you are on Earth, and on the "
"Date. By default, the Tool adopts the Location and Date from the current "
"&kstars; settings. You can change these parameters in the <guilabel>"
"Date &amp; Location</guilabel> Tab. To change the Location, you can press the "
"<guibutton>Choose City...</guibutton> button to open the <link "
"linkend=\"setgeo\">Set Geographic Location</link> Window, or enter Longitude "
"and Latitude values manually in the input fields, and press the <guibutton>"
"Update</guibutton> button. To change the Date, use the spin and combo boxes, "
"then press <guibutton>Update</guibutton>. Note that any curves you had already "
"plotted will be automatically updated when you change the Date and/or Location."

"Plot the Sun's Altitude curve. Make sure the geographic location is not near "
"the equator. Change the Date to some time in June, and then again to sometime "
"in January. You can see easily why we have seasons; in the winter, the Sun is "
"above the horizon for less time (the days are shorter), and its altitude is "
"never very high."
