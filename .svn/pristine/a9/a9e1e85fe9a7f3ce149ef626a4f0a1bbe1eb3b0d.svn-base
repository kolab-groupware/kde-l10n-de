"The Equinoxes are important for marking the seasons. Because they are on the "
"<link linkend=\"ai-ecliptic\">Ecliptic</link>, the Sun passes through each "
"equinox every year. When the Sun passes through the Vernal Equinox (usually on "
"March 21st), it crosses the <link linkend=\"ai-cequator\">"
"Celestial Equator</link> from South to North, signifying the end of Winter for "
"the Northern hemisphere. Similarly, when the Sun passes through the Autumnal "
"Equinox (usually on September 21st), it crosses the Celestial Equator from "
"North to South, signifying the end of Winter for the Southern hemisphere."
