"Locations on Earth can be specified using a spherical coordinate system. The "
"geographic (<quote>earth-mapping</quote>) coordinate system is aligned with the "
"spin axis of the Earth. It defines two angles measured from the center of the "
"Earth. One angle, called the <firstterm>Latitude</firstterm>"
", measures the angle between any point and the Equator. The other angle, called "
"the <firstterm>Longitude</firstterm>, measures the angle <emphasis>"
"along</emphasis> the Equator from an arbitrary point on the Earth (Greenwich, "
"England is the accepted zero-longitude point in most modern societies)."

"By combining these two angles, any location on Earth can be specified. For "
"example, Baltimore, Maryland (USA) has a latitude of 39.3 degrees North, and a "
"longitude of 76.6 degrees West. So, a vector drawn from the center of the Earth "
"to a point 39.3 degrees above the Equator and 76.6 degrees west of Greenwich, "
"England will pass through Baltimore."

"The Equator is obviously an important part of this coordinate system; it "
"represents the <emphasis>zeropoint</emphasis> of the latitude angle, and the "
"halfway point between the poles. The Equator is the <firstterm>"
"Fundamental Plane</firstterm> of the geographic coordinate system. <link "

"Lines of constant Latitude are called <firstterm>Parallels</firstterm>"
". They trace circles on the surface of the Earth, but the only parallel that is "
"a <link linkend=\"ai-greatcircle\">Great Circle</link> "
"is the Equator (Latitude=0 degrees). Lines of constant Longitude are called "
"<firstterm>Meridians</firstterm>. The Meridian passing through Greenwich is the "
"<firstterm>Prime Meridian</firstterm> (longitude=0 degrees). Unlike Parallels, "
"all Meridians are great circles, and Meridians are not parallel: they intersect "
"at the north and south poles."
