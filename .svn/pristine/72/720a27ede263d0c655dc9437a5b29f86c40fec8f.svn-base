"The above screenshot shows a typical view of the &kstars; program. You can see "
"the sky display centered on Betelgeuse, the brightest star in the constellation "
"Orion. Orion has just risen above the eastern horizon. Stars are displayed with "
"<link linkend=\"ai-colorandtemp\">realistic colors</link> "
"and relative brightnesses. In three corners of the sky display, there are "
"on-screen text labels displaying data on the current time (<quote>"
"LT: 20:16:09 Tuesday 23 November 2010</quote>), the current Geographic Location "
"(<quote>Fremont, California, USA</quote>), and the current object in the center "
"of the display (<quote>Focused on: Betelgeuse (alpha Orionis)</quote>"
"). Above the sky display, there are two toolbars. The main toolbar contains "
"shortcuts for <link linkend=\"kstars-menus\">menu functions</link>"
", as well as a time-step widget which controls how fast the simulation clock "
"runs. The view toolbar contains buttons that toggle the display of different "
"kinds of objects in the sky. At the bottom of the window, there is a status bar "
"which displays the name of any object you click on, and the <link "
"linkend=\"ai-skycoords\">sky coordinates</link> (both Right "
"Ascension/Declination and Azimuth/Altitude) of the mouse cursor."
