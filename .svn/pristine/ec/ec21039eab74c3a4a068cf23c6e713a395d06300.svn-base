"Apart from offering you the normal copy, cut and paste functionality that you "
"would expect to copy objects between different diagrams, &umbrello; can copy "
"the objects as PNG pictures so that you can insert them into any other type of "
"document. You do not need to do anything special to use this feature, just "
"select an object from a diagram (Class, Actor, &etc;) and copy it (<keycombo>"
"&Ctrl;<keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>, or using the menu), then open a "
"<application>Calligra Words</application> document (or any program into which "
"you can paste images) and select <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem>"
". This is a great feature to export parts of your diagram as simple pictures."
