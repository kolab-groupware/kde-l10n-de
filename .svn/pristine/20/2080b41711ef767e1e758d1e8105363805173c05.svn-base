"Despite comprehensive maps of the nearby universe that cover the spectrum from "
"radio to gamma rays, we are only able to account of 10% of the mass that must "
"be out there. As Bruce H. Margon, an astronomer at the University of "
"Washington, told the New York Times in 2001: <quote>"
"It's a fairly embarrassing situation to admit that we can't find 90 percent of "
"the universe.</quote>"

"The term given this <quote>missing mass</quote> is <firstterm>"
"Dark Matter</firstterm>, and those two words pretty well sum up everything we "
"know about it at this point. We know there is <quote>Matter</quote>"
", because we can see the effects of its gravitational influence. However, the "
"matter emits no detectable electromagnetic radiation at all, hence it is <quote>"
"Dark</quote>. There exist several theories to account for the missing mass "
"ranging from exotic subatomic particles, to a population of isolated black "
"holes, to less exotic brown and white dwarfs. The term <quote>"
"missing mass</quote> might be misleading, since the mass itself is not missing, "
"just its light. But what is exactly dark matter and how do we really know it "
"exists, if we cannot see it?"

"The story began in 1933 when Astronomer Fritz Zwicky was studying the motions "
"of distant and massive clusters of galaxies, specifically the Coma cluster and "
"the Virgo cluster. Zwicky estimated the mass of each galaxy in the cluster "
"based on their luminosity, and added up all of the galaxy masses to get a total "
"cluster mass. He then made a second, independent estimate of the cluster mass, "
"based on measuring the spread in velocities of the individual galaxies in the "
"cluster. To his suprise, this second <firstterm>dynamical mass</firstterm> "
"estimate was <emphasis>400 times</emphasis> larger than the estimate based on "
"the galaxy light."

"Although the evidence was strong at Zwicky's time, it was not until the 1970s "
"that scientists began to explore this discrepancy comprehensively. It was at "
"this time that the existence of Dark Matter began to be taken seriously. The "
"existence of such matter would not only resolve the mass deficit in galaxy "
"clusters; it would also have far more reaching consequences for the evolution "
"and fate of the universe itself."

"Another phenomenon that suggested the need for dark matter is the rotational "
"curves of <firstterm>Spiral Galaxies</firstterm>. Spiral Galaxies contain a "
"large population of stars that orbit the Galactic center on nearly circular "
"orbits, much like planets orbit a star. Like planetary orbits, stars with "
"larger galactic orbits are expected to have slower orbital speeds (this is just "
"a statement of Kepler's 3rd Law). Actually, Kepler's 3rd Law only applies to "
"stars near the perimeter of a Spiral Galaxy, because it assumes the mass "
"enclosed by the orbit to be constant."

"However, astronomers have made observations of the orbital speeds of stars in "
"the outer parts of a large number of spiral galaxies, and none of them follow "
"Kepler's 3rd Law as expected. Instead of falling off at larger radii, the "
"orbital speeds remain remarkably constant. The implication is that the mass "
"enclosed by larger-radius orbits increases, even for stars that are apparently "
"near the edge of the galaxy. While they are near the edge of the luminous part "
"of the galaxy, the galaxy has a mass profile that apparently continues well "
"beyond the regions occupied by stars."

"Here is another way to think about it: Consider the stars near the perimeter of "
"a spiral galaxy, with typical observed orbital velocities of 200 kilometers per "
"second. If the galaxy consisted of only the matter that we can see, these stars "
"would very quickly fly off from the galaxy, because their orbital speeds are "
"four times larger than the galaxy's escape velocity. Since galaxies are not "
"seen to be spinning apart, there must be mass in the galaxy that we are not "
"accounting for when we add up all the parts we can see."

"Several theories have surfaced in literature to account for the missing mass "
"such as <acronym>WIMP</acronym>s (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), "
"<acronym>MACHO</acronym>s (MAssive Compact Halo Objects), primordial black "
"holes, massive neutrinos, and others; each with their pros and cons. No single "
"theory has yet been accepted by the astronomical community, because we so far "
"lack the means to conclusively test one theory against the other."
