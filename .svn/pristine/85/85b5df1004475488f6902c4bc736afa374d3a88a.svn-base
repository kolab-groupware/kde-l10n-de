"<firstterm>Retrograde Motion</firstterm> is the orbital motion of a body in a "
"direction opposite that which is normal to spatial bodies within a given "
"system."

"When we observe the sky, we expect most objects to appear to move in a "
"particular direction with the passing of time. The apparent motion of most "
"bodies in the sky is from east to west. However it is possible to observe a "
"body moving west to east, such as an artificial satellite or space shuttle that "
"is orbiting eastward. This orbit is considered Retrograde Motion."

"Retrograde Motion is most often used in reference to the motion of the outer "
"planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and so forth). Though these planets appear to "
"move from east to west on a nightly basis in response to the spin of the Earth, "
"they are actually drifting slowly eastward with respect to the stationary "
"stars, which can be observed by noting the position of these planets for "
"several nights in a row. This motion is normal for these planets, however, and "
"not considered Retrograde Motion. However, since the Earth completes its orbit "
"in a shorter period of time than these outer planets, we occasionally overtake "
"an outer planet, like a faster car on a multiple-lane highway. When this "
"occurs, the planet we are passing will first appear to stop its eastward drift, "
"and it will then appear to drift back toward the west. This is Retrograde "
"Motion, since it is in a direction opposite that which is typical for planets. "
"Finally, as the Earth swings past the planet in its orbit, they appear to "
"resume their normal west-to-east drift on successive nights."

"This Retrograde Motion of the planets puzzled ancient Greek astronomers, and "
"was one reason why they named these bodies <quote>planets</quote> "
"which in Greek means <quote>wanderers</quote>."
